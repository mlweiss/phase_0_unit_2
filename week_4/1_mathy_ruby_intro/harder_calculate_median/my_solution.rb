# U2.W4: SOLO CHALLENGE Calculate the Median!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge by myself

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# The input is an array of real numbers or strings.
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# The output is the median of the numbers with respect to the natural order on the real numbers
# or in the case of strings the median of the 'words' with respect to the alphabetical order
# on the alphabet.
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# 1.) The parity of the number of items in the list is determined.
# 2.) The list needs to be sorted with respect to the order.
# 3.) If the list is odd return the middle element of the list.
# 3.) If the list is even return the mean of the two middle elements.
# Note: Need to think of a definition of the mean of two strings. However this may 
# not return a meaningful result.
